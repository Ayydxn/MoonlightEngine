Moonlight Engine is a free and open-source game engine written in C++ that is made with simplicity, ease-of-use and performance in mind. Currently, the engine only supports 2D. However, support for 3D is on the way.

⚠️ Moonlight is in active development and stability is absolutely **not guaranteed**. This can range from bugs and glitches to the engine not even running or crashing.
